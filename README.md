# TypeScript WeatherApp

This repository is created from the textbook "The First React App with
TypeScript" (Japanese) to see how React functions in TypeScript code.
The original GitHub Repositry is [here](https://github.com/mod728/react-typescript-book-weather-app).

The tech stack in the textbook and is new to me are following. 

1. Node.js (and npm within)
2. TypeScript
3. React
4. Netlify (to deploy)

Here I finished until just before the deployment.
